// Given an array of N distinct integers, transform the array into a zig zag sequence by permuting the array elements.
// A sequence will be called a zig zag sequence if the first K elements in the sequence are in increasing order and the last K elements are in decreasing order, where K = (N+1)/2.
// You need to find the lexicographically smallest zig zag sequence of the given array.
